[200~Git Is a SCM
What is SCM?
SCM is a Source Code Manager
Git is the one of the important DevOps tool, Git allow the engineers
to colaborate on and from the development leve up to the production level
Distributed VCS:
  ===============
GIT: DVCs 
  Distributed Version Control system 
  - Git manage data as snapshots. 0 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 
  - It takes a picture of what all your files look like 
     at that moment and stores 
    a reference to that snapshot.
    Benefits: Nearly every operation is local
            git has data intergrity
            Git generally only adds data

deply.java
    echo "Welcome to Paypal"                    = Bee
    echo "Paypal your payment gateway"          = Olayinka  
    echo "Paypal is the gateway of the future"  = Adeyinka  
    echo "Paypal is offering 30% discount"      = Ayomide
    echo "Good deals for returing clients"      = Olubunmi
